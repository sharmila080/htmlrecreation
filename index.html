<p>Full stack development refers to the end-to-end application software development, including the front end and back end.
The front end consists of the user interface, and the back end takes care of the business logic and application
workflows.Full stack developers are free to use any set of languages that are compatible with each other and the overall
application framework. JavaScript is a popular language often used by full-stack developers as it‚Äôs one of the very few
languages that can be used both on the front end and back end. Companies will most likely hire a full stack developer
for smaller or medium-size projects.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Applications that require higher scalability and more complex workflows require broader skill sets and collaboration
across teams. For example, the front end may be handled by the UI team, and the back end by another team. In some
organizations, individuals will be required to work on both the front-end and back-end implementation of a feature. This
is where full stack developers would come into play.</p>
